TO: Mary, the president of the education company<br>

SUBJECT: Recommendation Report for mitigating losses and increasing profitability<br>

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
The purpose of the report is to find operation problems of the company and the corresponding solutions. During the covid-19 period, our company has lost 14% profits this quarter, most of the issues are less new students, the low rate of students continues studying, inappropriate price, the inflexible course style, some unnecessary courses offered and so on. In order to help our company to mitigate losses and increase profitability, I have some ideas for you to choose to improve our company's current situation.

I. Increase publicity efforts<br>
-Bonus to old students to renew the course<br>
-Discount for new students<br>
-Open a trial class<br>

II. Appropriate adjustment of classes<br>
-Cancel some unwelcome courses<br>
-Increase some subject courses in high demand<br>
-Set up private courses<br>

That is all methods I have list out to help our company get rid of the current situation. I will give specific descriptions of each list and how to execute it, the benefit of the result.

<h1 align="center">Solution 1: Increase publicity efforts</h1>
> “Consumer acquisition is a crucial part of a platform's growth strategy and pivotal for successful interactions with sellers” (Poddar et al., 2022).

The best development for a company is to cooperate with old customers and attracts new customers at the same time. Old customers can keep the stable operation of a company, and the new customers can promote the profit for the company. I plan to start with these three areas, a discount for new students, some bonus for old students to renew the course and open a trial class.

<h2 align="center">Discount for new students</h2>
> “The discount strategy adopted by a platform acts as a device for expanding user base which is the prime concern for any platform. Moreover, a platform uses advertising signals to expand its reach to buyers so that buyers can get information about discounts and get attracted to participate on the platform” (Poddar et al., 2022). 

When our platform posts the discount, new customers will be attracted to the discount to our institute to consult. It is the first opportunity for us to introduce our company teaching level, the second step is to show new customers around to let them know our teaching atmosphere to let them trust us. Compare with just knowing the price of other institutes, after a comprehensive understanding of the visit and discount, customers will place the order with passion. It seems that our company made less money per student but attracted more students, and overall sales increased finally.

<h2 align="center">Bonus to old students to renew the course</h2>
With the end of the semester, courses are going to finish, but the new courses for next semester can order in advance. For new customers, they get a discount from our company, if old students do not get any bonus, which will lead to mental imbalance. How to maintain existing guests, stop them to other institutes, the bonus for old students plays an important function. For example, old customers can get 10% off their renewable price. If they introduce their classmates or friends to our company, they can get a gift card or toy as a bonus. In that way, it is also an easier way to attract new customers with fewer human resources. The gift card purchase can cooperate with that company at a cheap price to wholesale gift cards. Even though they do not all used up, they can be the rewards for our employees in the future. Current students learning results are the best publicity word of mouth. Because people prefer to trust the internal push of familiar people.

<h2 align="center">Open a trial class</h2>
The main purpose for parents to choose a good institute is the good teaching class. Open trail class for free for all interested students. We choose the best teachers for the trial class to show our outstanding teacher resources and good study atmosphere. A good trial class is the best advertisement. After a good trial class, patient explanations from teachers will create a trusting bridge between our company and students. In a careful environmental situation, parents prefer to take the course immediately. Besides, the activity is hosted in our company without an extra site use fee but receives many new customers with less investment capital.

<h1 align="center">Solution 2: Appropriate adjustment of classes</h1>
Each step of the company's growth corresponds to a different pace, each pace followed by a different policy according to the current environmental situation. For our company during the pandemic period, appropriate adjustment of classes with the requirement of the market is beneficial to our future development. I will focus on cancelling unwelcome courses, increasing some subject courses in higher demand, and setting up private courses.

<h2 align="center">Cancel some unwelcome courses</h2>
To our season research, in some courses like public English corner, the promotion of students’ oral ability is slow, and the effect is poor. The kind, of course, requires students in the classroom to have an atmosphere for the discussion, but due to the changeable policy of covid-19, it is hard to control the number and time. I suggest some courses like this can be cancelled. This method can reduce the unnecessary waste of human resources and losses.

For the employee’s adjustment, they do not need to worry lose their jobs. These teachers can be the trainers to train new employees or colleagues who are not familiar with the education model of our company. 

> “They should enhance the knowledge distribution and interpretation within the firm, for example by using formal mechanisms to guarantee the sharing of best practices among different employees and departments, making employees talk to each other, using teamwork, making individuals responsible for collecting, assembling, and distributing employee's suggestions internally” (Innovation and organizational performance 2020).

Train current employees’ information exchange and share group results to achieve the maximum interior benefit to reduce unnecessary recruitment.

<h2 align="center">Increase some subject courses in high demand</h2>
According to the feedback of registration, the requirement of math courses always supplies falls short of demand. Obviously, math courses are very popular with students do not affect by any environment, even covid-19. We can appropriately increase the number of mathematics courses, not only limited to tutoring mathematics homework but also including Olympic mathematics, calculus, algebra and so on. Multiply math-related courses for students to choose also to increase their competence in other institutions and the increase company awareness. Not all educational institutions can offer so many courses with high-quality teacher resources. However, increasing courses mean the frequency of use increases, and it requires us to arrange the schedule more seriously than usual.

<h2 align="center">Set up private courses</h2>
> “Another important issue related to instructional development is the impact of training and improved outcomes of training for future instructors on their actual teaching practices” (Ibrahim et al., 2020). 

Teachers with professional knowledge can be more appropriate to the case, and quickly improve students' academic performance in a short time. Set up private courses for some students who lack independent learning ability, poor foundation, and partial subject. 

>“In general, students who eagerly need assistance in study and who are able to afford the cost are more likely to choose one-to-one” (Zhang & Liu, 2016). 

Because private classes enable teachers to teach students following their aptitude, the reason is that a teacher only services only one student. For each private class, it is more expensive than a large class from per student’s perspective, but the total income of a large class is over a private class. However, the arrangement of private classes is flexible, it can be scheduled according to teachers' and students' times.

<h1 align="center">Conclusion</h1>
They are all the best ways I have thought of so far to help our company improve the current deficit situation. The company can make corresponding policy adjustments according to the change in the market environment, which may be much better than following a stagnant policy.

Hope my suggestions can help our company overcome difficulties and increase profitability. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to connect me. I can be reached at 600-700-8000 or corazhenyanwu@outlook.com. Thank you for the time to read my recommendation report.
