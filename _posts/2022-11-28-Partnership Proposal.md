Background: Abbotsford Canucks of the AHL playing hockey next door to UFV Abbotsford Campus!


We believe that UFV should have a new association to build a “partnership” with the new team, which may include having some UFV marketing involved and maybe some sponsorship opportunities? What about providing some work opportunities with the team utilizing our CIS or Business students. Brainstorm what UFV would need to get this new program/association off the ground, and some certain trade-offs that could be offered!

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
Recently, our school has received the news about the Abbotsford Canucks of AHL playing hockey next door to our Abbotsford Campus. I believe that UFV could establish a partnership with the Abbotsford Canucks by assisting them with their games with the help of volunteers from different departments of our school. Such as visual arts, accounting, nursing, music, graphic design, film, Computer Information Systems (CIS), marketing, etc. Each department selects one or two volunteers as representatives to join the meeting. This would include a discussion of the details about how to construct the partnership and determine the responsibilities of their department. After the meeting, every representative divides the work among the volunteers to ensure practicability.

Before the hockey game begins, accounting, marketing, business analytics, graphic design, and visual arts student volunteers ought to prepare in advance.

-The duty of accounting students is to prepare a proposed budget for each step.
-Marketing majors’ main goal is to look for sponsors. Such as fitness gyms for equipment for warm-up purposes, or food trucks to sell hamburgers, soft drinks, hot dogs and so on during the break.
-At the same time, business analytics students can survey the campus about which kind of food is most welcomed to the audience so that marketing students can find the proper sponsors.
-The graphic design students were assigned the task of creating merchandise to attract audiences to purchase them as souvenirs, which would provide Abbotsford Canucks extra income.
-One of the most time-consuming works is for the visual arts department, as they would need to take pictures and film the event from the beginning.

Initially, the departments of English, arts, film, music, CIS, and criminal justice share the work and cooperate with one another to advertise the game.
 
-This event also provides an opportunity for English major students to showcase their abilities as a host. It also demonstrates our student’s capability to control the atmosphere to audiences. 
-Posters are designed by art students and the film department creates promotion videos. 
-Music students can create a playlist to enliven the atmosphere.
-CIS major students are in charge of the computer operation and troubleshooting.
-Criminal and justice department map out a route and guide spectators to the entrance and parking.

Cheerleaders and nursing students will be spread throughout the stadium to maintain the flow of the event.
 
-Cheerleaders can choreograph for the opening of the show to warm up the audience.
-It is very common for athletes to get injured during violent collisions. Nursing students can provide emergency care for their wounds in the meantime.

At the end of the game, criminals, justice, and other volunteers are in charge of the tail-end work.
 
-Criminal and justice students are still responsible for keeping the order of exiting the stadium to avoid stampedes.
-All other volunteers are to stay and help to clean up the stadium.
 
Finally, media arts and journalism students are responsible for assisting other news networks to edit reports about the game.
 
-Media arts students can clip the most memorable moments into a video, and journalism students can summarize activities that were going on during the game into a report.

<h1 align="center">Conclusion</h1>
To create a partnership with the Abbotsford Canucks of AHL, many hours and work will be involved both in front and behind the scenes. It requires communication, collaboration, and arranging time reasonably between many departments. These are the keys to ensure a successful and promising partnership with Abbotsford Canucks. If our school can prove our worth, then it will open doors to other opportunities in the future.
