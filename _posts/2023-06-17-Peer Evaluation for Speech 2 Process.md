SUBJECT: Peer Evaluation for Speech 2 Process<br>

The purpose of this evaluation is to discuss speech 2 “How to make Reese’s dessert butter cake”. I will analyze what I like, what you can improve, and the overall performance of the presentation.

<h1 align="center">Things I liked</h1>
Great hand gestures throughout the whole video. Introduce materials for the butter cake concisely with hand gestures (0:53). One material, one hand gesture. When you introduce an egg, even if it is just a simple egg, you grab the egg in one hand and use another hand to be a tray, which is naturally great to introduce food in the video but not embarrassing. Big action for each step makes the whole screen very full, a good vision for the audience. The good structure of the body speech clearly explains the process of cake and also interacts with the camera to show the form after whisking (3:31).

<h1 align="center">Things you could improve on</h1>
At the beginning of the video, maybe you are nervous, you look left, right and upside from time to time, 10 times in the first 40 seconds. Next time, try to look at the camera, pretend the camera is your friend, talk with it and look at the package when you unwrap it. If you can remove Reese’s package during baking (0:48), that would be much better. Try to reduce the verbal filter “em, em, em”, or you can have a transfer pause like what you did in “and milk” (3:05). That “and” is a great pause without extracting words but have time to think about the next step. 

<h1 align="center">Conclusion</h1>
In conclusion, nice music creates an easy, casual baking environment. Fix error tactfully (1:32) to make it funny, also interesting baking achievement (4:32) to delight the audience. The same ending to responding begins like a food blogger. Good job!
e teachers to teach students following their aptitude, the reason is that a teacher only services only one student. For each private class, it is more expensive than a large class from per student’s perspective, but the total income of a large class is over a private class. However, the arrangement of private classes is flexible, it can be scheduled according to teachers' and students' times.
